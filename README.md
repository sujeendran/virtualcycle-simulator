BTech final year project - Virtual Cycle simulator using Arduino and Unity3D
Author: Sujeendran Menon

This repository contains few of the C# scripts and captures of the Virtual Cycle Simulation Project we completed for our Bachelor of Engineering final year project.
The C# scripts were custom coded to fit our needs as we needed an interface for the hardware sensors, mechanical parts and arduino to interact with the user of the simulator. Some codes are not the final version of the end product.
Multiple versions of the controller scripts exist for debugging as we needed keyboard controls and cycle hardware controls.
